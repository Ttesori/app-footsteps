- Got CRU working on the front end. Planning to add D tomorrow or Monday. Ran into some organization issues that could be helped by integrating Context API but okay with prop drilling for now
- Looking forward to implementing react router
- Almost added momentJS for dates, but decided to manually transform them for now since I only needed basic transforms in 2 places
- Got stuck for a bit trying to figure out why a prop wasn't updating with useEffect, only to realize I forgot to add the curly braces around the variable name in the component's function parameter - whoopsies!
- Resisting the urge to do any styling is a challenge, but it's good to focus on semantic HTML. Also want to be sure to implement accessibility features before beginning styling
